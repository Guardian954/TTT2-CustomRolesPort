# TTT2-CustomRolesPort
A port of some of the custom roles mods roles for TTT2

This has been made for fun for my server and bugs may exist but feel free to report them.

## Currently includes:
### Team Jester
**Beggar**
 - Converts to persons team that gives them a bought item, cannot die, cannot win.
 
**Clown** 
- Team Jester, Becomes the Killer Clown if they survive to the round end and then has to kill the remaining team.

**Swapper** 
- Swaps roles and all equipment with their killer on death. Their killer is then given a set health as the new swapper.

### Team Innocent

**Phantom** 
- Team Innocent, Haunts their killer and will resurrect when their killer is killed. Will also be able to possess and troll (energy permitting) if the convar is left enabled.


All Convars are adjustable via the [TTT2 Ulx Commmands](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1362430347) which is recommended if youre running TTT2.
